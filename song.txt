Just another night, no sleep
Staring at the wall again
Always know that I am in deep
When I start ignoring all my friends
I don't even know the problems
So how am I supposed to solve 'em?
Still I'm drinking like it stops 'em
I feel too much and nothing at all
Lately, I feel a little crazy
I wish someone could save me now
I can't take these emotions
Damn these emotions
Lately, no, I don't even know myself
Keep wishing I was someone else
'Cause I can't take these emotions
Damn these emotions
Damn these emotions
